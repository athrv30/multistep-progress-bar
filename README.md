Approach
-Create a multi-step form structure with HTML and style it using CSS.
-Use JavaScript to handle step transitions, progress tracking, and button interactions.
-Add event listeners to the "Next" and "Previous" buttons for step navigation.
-Update the progress bar width and active step indicator as users navigate.
-Toggle the visibility of fieldsets to show the current step and hide others.
-Implement a "Finish" step to indicate completion of the multi-step process.
